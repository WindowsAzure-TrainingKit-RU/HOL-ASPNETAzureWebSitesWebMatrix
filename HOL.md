# Building and Publishing Web Applications with Windows Azure Web Sites and WebMatrix 2#

---
<a name="Overview"></a>
## Overview ##

In this Hands-on Lab you will learn how to use Microsoft WebMatrix 2 to build and publish web sites in Windows Azure.

Microsoft WebMatrix is a free tool that allows you to create, customize and publish web sites. WebMatrix includes a range of built-in templates to make it quick and easy to get started with your web site code and provides built-in publishing support to help you easily publish your web sites to Windows Azure.

Following the exercises, you will create a new Web Site from the Windows Azure Management Portal and start to build your Web Site locally using WebMatrix. By using a WebMatrix out-of-the-box template, you will quickly create a photo gallery application and customize it by adding a Facebook Like button. Finally, you will publish the resulting web application to Windows Azure using WebMatrix built-in publishing support.

#### Task 1 – Creating a New Windows Azure Web Site ####

In this task, you will create a new Web Site from the Windows Azure Management Portal.

1. Open [Windows Azure Management Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com) and log in with your Windows Azure Account's credentials.

1. Click **New** | **Web Site** | **Quick Create**. Select a unique **URL** for your web site, for example _WebMatrixWebSite_.

	![Creating a new Web Site](images/creating-a-new-web-site.png?raw=true "Creating a new Web Site")

	_Creating a new Web Site_

	> **Note:** A Windows Azure Web Site is the host for a web application running in the cloud that you can control and manage. The Quick Create option allows you to deploy a completed web application to the Windows Azure Web Site from outside the portal. It does not include steps for setting up a database.

1. Wait until the Web Site is **Running** before continuing to the next task.

<a name="Ex1Task2"></a>
#### Task 2 – Creating a Web Site using WebMatrix Templates ####

In this task, you will download and install WebMatrix  and then create a site using the Photo Gallery template.

1. In the **Windows Azure Management Portal**, click Web Sites and then click the Web Site **name** you created in the previous task to go to its **Dashboard**.
